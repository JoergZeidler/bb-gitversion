# Concourse pipeline integration guide

For using this concourse CI pipeline it is recommended to have two config files:

-   `config.yaml`: for production purposes
-   `config.local.yaml`: for development and testing purposes

The `config.yaml` is used to access the projects production release repository and branch and a real cloud S3 endpoint to store version artifacts.
The `config.local.yaml` is used to develop and test the pipeline for building blocks. It is used with your private fork or local repository of the building block as well as a local S3 endpoint.

# Example concourse CI pipeline

This example is intended to show the integration of a build pipeline in a derived building block.

## Adaptions for your building block

This section describes what needs to be done within the several files. 
**Note that files called `credentials.yaml` are ignored by `.gitignore` and will not be checked in.**

### config.example.yaml

Open the `config.example.yaml` and specify the fields that are described.
This config file shows an example for a fictive building block called `bb-example`.

Note: if you are using a real S3 endpoint you should enter those data. If you are using the local test environment specify like below.

    ---
    # General stuff
    # -------------
    ## Specifies the name of the buildingblock
    name: bb-example
    ## Specifies the version used for bb-gitversion
    bb-gitversion-version: 0.2.0

    # Git relevant stuff
    # ------------------
    ## Specify the git repository to work with
    git_source: https://github.com/elbb/bb-example
    ## Specify the branch to work with
    git_branch: master
    ## This enables/disables ssl verification of the git resource
    git_skip_ssl_verification: false

    # S3 relevant stuff
    # -----------------
    ## Specify the S3 endpoint URI
    s3_endpoint: http://172.17.0.1:9000
    ## Specify access key and secret key
    s3_access_key: localaccess
    s3_secret_key: localsecret
    ## This enables/disables the ssl verification for the S3 endpoint
    s3_disable_ssl: true

### credentials.example.yaml

**Note: Make sure that you have set up ssh access with your ssh-key in your git repository. **
Fill in your ssh private key in `credentials.example.yaml` and rename it to `credentials.yaml`.

### pipeline.example.yaml

We assume that the git repository for bb-example contains parts the following file structure:

    .
    ├── docker
    |   ├── Dockerfile

A docker image is wanted as build artifact versioned with gitversion.

Adapt the last section in the `pipeline.example.yaml` to match your needs. 
The example builds the docker image with the Dockerfile located in `docker/Dockerfile` and creates a tag generated by a previous step running `bb-gitversion`.

      ...
      - name: Create docker image for ((name)) and push it
        public: true
        plan:
          - in_parallel:
              - get: source
              - get: s3-gitversion
                params:
                  unpack: true
          - put: image-((name))
            params:
              build: source/docker
              dockerfile: source/docker/Dockerfile
              additional_tags: s3-gitversion/plain/SemVer
              tag_as_latest: true

## Using the pipeline

Use `fly` to setup the pipeline with concourse CI.

Once you've setup your concourse CI server (either hosted or local) upload the pipeline:

    $ fly -t <target> set-pipeline -n -p bb-example -l config.example.yaml -l credentials.yaml -c pipeline.example.yaml
